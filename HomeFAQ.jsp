<h3>Frequently Asked Questionaires!!</h3>
<p>
<h2>
WHAT ARE THE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT PRINCIPLES (WEPs)?</h2>
The Women's Empowerment Principles offer seven steps to guide business
 on how to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community. 
 Subtitled Equality Means Business, the Principles emphasize the business 
 case for corporate action to promote gender equality and women's empowerment and
  are informed by real-life business practices and input gathered from across the globe.
  </p>
  <p>
Rather than being prescriptive or a new initiative to which business is asked to subscribe, 
the WEPs seek to point the way to best practice by elaborating the gender dimension of good
 corporate citizenship, the UN Global Compact, and business' role in sustainable development.
</p>


<p>
<h2>
WHO DEVELOPED THE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT PRINCIPLES?</h2>
The WEPs are the result of a collaboration between the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the United Nations 
Global Compact (UNGC) and are adapted from the Calvert Women's Principles®.

  </p>
  <p>
The Calvert Women's Principles were originally developed in partnership with UNIFEM
 (now part of UN Women) and launched in 2004 as the first global corporate code of conduct
  focused exclusively on empowering, advancing and investing in women worldwide.

The Women's Empowerment Principles were developed through a year-long international
 multi-stakeholder consultation process and launched to the global community on 
 International Women's Day 2010 (8 March).
</p>

<p>
<h2>
WHAT IS THE CEO STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR THE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT PRINCIPLES?</h2>
The CEO Statement of Support for the Women's Empowerment Principles offers business leaders 
an opportunity to signal their support for the overall goal of advancing and empowering women
 and specifically, the guidance offered by the WEPs. It also provides a platform for corporate
  executives to encourage fellow business leaders to support the Principles by signing the Statement.
Signers of the CEO Statement underscore that equal treatment of women and men is not just
 the right thing to do—it is also good for business and should be a corporate priority.

  </p>
  <p>
The Principles were developed as a voluntary framework and resource for companies dedicated 
to advancing gender equality. Signing the CEO Statement of Support does not constitute any type
 of binding obligation. However, signing the CEO Statement is a great way to demonstrate the first
  Principle, which is: “Establish high-level corporate leadership for gender equality”, 
  and it has now been signed by over 550 chief executives of companies around the world.
